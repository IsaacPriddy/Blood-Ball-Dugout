// TODO List (for v1.0):
//  1. Rename the app (Saw something online called Dugout, if that is not in use I like that one)
//  2. Get the Play Screen Working
//    - Needs to keep score
//    - Needs to have popups for rerolls (think MTG LifeElk and poison)
//    - Might need: Weather, kickoff table, etc.
//  3. Get the Skills Screen Working
//    - Maybe: Implement a search function to find something specific
//  4. Get the Rosters Screen Working (and displaying right)
//    - Don't need roster/team creation yet
//    - Need to get it formatted correctly
//  5. Get a better icon created for the app
