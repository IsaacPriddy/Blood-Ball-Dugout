# Tabletop Game Aid 1
This is my attempt at recreating what I made before while also improving on several aspects such as the design and utility.
My experience with flutter and dart is low and it has been some time since I used either, so with that in mind this is also a way to showcase my ability to learn a new language and create something with it.
